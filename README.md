# Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator

## Description

This is a project that can create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).
This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

## Installation

To use this application, the user needs to install node.js and run: 
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

The user has to run the following command
```bash
node index.js
```

Through inquirer, the user will get prompts and with these inputs the README file will be generated.
